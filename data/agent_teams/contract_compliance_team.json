For every risk you identify, provide: (1) Risk Category (High/Medium/Low), (2) Clause or Section impacted, (3) Description of the issue, (4) Why it matters or what exposure it creates, and (5) Suggested edit or corrective language. Apply the risk scoring framework: High = escalate immediately; Medium = requires revision; Low = minor issue. Be precise, legally aligned, and practical.
