    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This integration connects to QuickBooks Online to retrieve accounting reports and data for Monthly End Review (MER) workflows.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>QuickBooks Online accounting data and reports that the authorized user permits via Intuit OAuth 2.0.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To generate bookkeeping review checks (for example, balance sheet reconciliation checks).</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. Data is shared only with authorized personnel and service providers used to operate the integration, subject to appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <p>Retention depends on your internal policies and system configuration. Tokens and logs should be retained only as long as necessary for operations and compliance.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect data. Access is controlled via role-based access and OAuth authorization.</p>
